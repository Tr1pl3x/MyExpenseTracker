I want a simple expense tracker backend. I want this backend to be deployed in serverless way in vercel.

Framework: FastAPI

I have neon db for the database

ROUTES:

/auth/login
/auth/register
/auth/logout

expense/create_expense
expense/delete_expense
expense/list_expense
expense/list_expense_by_category

stats/total
stats/total_by_category

Note:
when expense is created, the date will also include time.
When implementing, i also need to run locally so i can check if my api is running correctly before deploying.


limitation: 
users will be limited to default categories.
